      <h2>Epicodus Track Survey</h2>
        <p>As you know, Epicodus students must decide which track they would like to pursue before they enroll. While all languages have similarities, and switching between languages and platforms is very common in both internships and jobs, applicants should still choose the track they wish to complete with care.

        Currently, Epicodus offers the following tracks in Portland and Seattle:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ruby/Rails</li>
            <li>PHP/Drupal</li>
            <li>Java/Android</li>
            <li>CSS/Design</li>
            <li>C#/.NET</li>
          </ul>
          <p>(All tracks must complete Intro and JavaScript.)</p>
